This guide will help you get started with the Mindee Python  OCR SDK to easily extract data from your documents.

The Python  OCR SDK supports [invoice](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/python-invoice-ocr), [passport](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/python-passport-ocr), [receipt](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/python-receipt-ocr) OCR APIs and [custom-built API](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/python-api-builder) from the API Builder.

You can view the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mindee/mindee-api-python), and the package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mindee/).

## Prerequisite

- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This library is officially supported on Python `3.7` to `3.11`.
- Download and install [pip package manager](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Installation
To quickly get started with the Python OCR SDK anywhere, the preferred installation method is via `pip`.

```shell
pip install mindee
```

### Development Installation
If you'll be modifying the source code, you'll need to install the development requirements to get started.

1. First clone the repo.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:mindee/mindee-api-python.git
```

2. Then navigate to the cloned directory and install all development requirements.

```shell
cd mindee-api-python
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
```

## Updating the Version
It is important to always check the version of the Mindee OCR SDK you are using, as new and updated features wonâ€™t work on old versions.

To check the installed version:
```shell
pip show mindee
```

To get the latest version:
```shell
pip install mindee --upgrade
```

To install a specific version:
```shell
pip install mindee==<your_version>
```

## Usage
To get started with Mindee's APIs, you need to create a `Client` and you're ready to go.

Let's take a deep dive into how this works.

## Initializing the Client
The `Client` centralizes document configurations in a single object.

The `Client` requires your [API key](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/make-your-first-request#create-an-api-key).

You can either pass these directly to the constructor or through environment variables.


### Pass the API key directly
```python
from mindee import Client
#  Init with your API key
mindee_client = Client(api_key="my-api-key")
```

### Set the API key in the environment
API keys should be set as environment variables, especially for any production deployment.

The following environment variable will set the global API key:
```shell
MINDEE_API_KEY="my-api-key"
```

Then in your code:
```python
from mindee import Client
#  Init without an API key
mindee_client = Client()
```

### Setting the Request Timeout
The request timeout can be set using an environment variable:
```shell
MINDEE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=200
```

## Loading a Document File
Before being able to send a document to the API, it must first be loaded.

You don't need to worry about different MIME types, the library will take care of handling
all supported types automatically.

Once a document is loaded, interacting with it is done in exactly the same way, regardless
of how it was loaded.

There are a few different ways of loading a document file, depending on your use case:

* [Path](#path)
* [File Object](#file-object)
* [Base64](#base64)
* [Bytes](#bytes)

### Path
Load from a file directly from disk. Requires an absolute path, as a string.

```python
input_doc = mindee_client.doc_from_path("/path/to/the/invoice.pdf")
```

### File Object
A normal Python file object with a path. **Must be in binary mode**.

```python
with open("/path/to/the/receipt.jpg", 'rb') as fo:
     input_doc = mindee_client.doc_from_file(fo)
```

### Base64
Requires a base64 encoded string.

**Note**: The original filename is required when calling the method.

```python
b64_string = "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAgGBgcGBQgHBwcJCQgKDBQNDAsLD...."
input_doc = mindee_client.doc_from_b64string(b64_string, "receipt.jpg")
```

### Bytes
Requires raw bytes.

**Note**: The original filename is required when calling the method.

```python
raw_bytes = b"%PDF-1.3\n%\xbf\xf7\xa2\xfe\n1 0 ob..."
input_doc = mindee_client.doc_from_bytes(raw_bytes, "invoice.pdf")
```

Loading from bytes is useful when using FastAPI `UploadFile` objects.

```python
@app.post("/process-file")
async def upload(upload: UploadFile):
    input_doc = mindee_client.doc_from_bytes(
        upload.file.read(),
        filename=upload.filename
    )
```

### URL
Allows sending an URL directly.

**Note**: No local operations can be performed on the input (such as removing pages from a PDF).

```python
input_doc = mindee_client.doc_from_url(url="https://www.example.com/invoice.pdf")
```

## Sending a File
To send a file to the API, we need to specify how to process the document.
This will determine which API endpoint is used and how the API return will be handled internally by the library.

More specifically, we need to set a `mindee.documents.TypeDocument` type as the first parameter of the `parse` method.

This is because the `parse` method's' return type depends on its first argument.

Each document type available in the library has its corresponding class, which inherit from the base `mindee.document.Document` class.
This is detailed in each document-specific guide.

### Off-the-Shelf Documents
Simply setting the correct class is enough:
```python
result = input_doc.parse(documents.TypeInvoiceV4)
```

### Custom Documents
The endpoint to use must also be set, this is done in the `endpoint_name` argument of the `parse` method:
```python
result = input_doc.parse(documents.TypeCustomV1, endpoint_name="wnine")
```

This is because the `CustomV1` class is enough to handle the return processing, but the actual endpoint needs to be specified.
